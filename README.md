*I like to build stuff and make things look awesome!*

I have always dabbled with web design as a hobby. It all started when I was 14, I built an internet radio station website so that my friends and I could broadcast our "DJ'in skills" to our school friends.

A few years ago I decided to take it more seriously and started doing freelance work for a media company where I would convert Photoshop designs into WordPress websites using HTML, CSS/SASS and frameworks such as Bootstrap.

It wasn't very long until I realised that this is what I wanted to do as a career. I fast tracked my ambitions to code by attending [Makers Academy](http://www.makersacademy.com/) an intensive 12 week coding bootcamp in London.

I am currently a front end developer intern [Finimize](http://www.finimize.com), where I have been working with React.js to build a fintech product for millennials to take control of their finances.

## Skills ü§π

#### Teamwork
I took part in a lot of pair programming sessions at Makers Academy, I would pair with someone different every day and this required me to able to adapt to different personalities very quickly. During my final project I was in a team of four, pair programming helped us get the front and back end built at the same time with minimal issues.

#### Design
While working at my previous job ([Benson & Company](http://www.bensoncompany.co.uk)) I was tasked with creating landing pages for the company services based on the company branding, such as [Full Access](http://full-access.co.uk/) and [Management Courses](http://www.managementcourseslondon.com/). I used various software to create designs for these pages such as Photoshop and Sketch.

#### Self Learning
Through out my time at Makers Academy I was constantly learning different languages in a very short time frame. During our final project which we had 2 weeks to complete our project, I managed to learn React Native in the first week and built the app in the second week.
