I have always dabbled with web design as a hobby. It all started when I was 14, I built an internet radio station website so that my friends and I could broadcast our "DJ'in skills" to our school friends.

A few years ago I decided to take it more seriously and started doing freelance work for a media company where I would convert Photoshop designs into WordPress websites using HTML, CSS/SASS and frameworks such as Bootstrap.

It wasn't very long until I realised that this is what I wanted to do as a career. I fast tracked my ambitions to code by attending [Makers Academy](http://www.makersacademy.com/) an intensive 12 week coding bootcamp in London.

## Skills ü§π

#### Teamwork

I took part in a lot of pair programming sessions at Makers Academy, I would pair with someone different every day and this required me to able to adapt to different personalities very quickly. During my final project I was in a team of four, pair programming helped us get the front and back end built at the same time with minimal issues.

#### Innovation

While working at [Mettrr](https://www.mettrr.com) I was tasked with creating website templates using the static site generator Hugo. This proved to not be scalable and very time consuming when generating all websites. In my spare time I developed a custom static site generator that would generate a website from a JSON file and is hosted on a AWS Lambda function coupled with an API gateway.

#### Self Learning

Through out my time at Makers Academy I was constantly learning different languages in a very short time frame. During our final project which we had 2 weeks to complete our project, I managed to learn React Native in the first week and built the app in the second week.
