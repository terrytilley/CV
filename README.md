## Terry Tilley

I like to build stuff and make things look awesome!

I have always dabbled with web design as a hobby until a few years ago when I decided to take it more seriously and started doing freelance work. It wasn't very long until I realised that this is what I wanted to do as a career. I fast tracked my ambitions to code by attending [Makers Academy](http://www.makersacademy.com/) an intensive 12 week coding bootcamp in London.

I'm currently looking for a full stack junior developer role in a team who are always looking to learn new technologies.
